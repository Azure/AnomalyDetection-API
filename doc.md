# Machine Learning Anomaly Detection API
## Overview
[Anomaly Detection API](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/MachineLearningAPI/Anomaly-Detection-2) is an example built with Azure Machine Learning that detects anomalies in time series data with numerical values that are uniformly spaced in time.

This API can detect the following types of anomalous patterns in time series data:

* **Positive and negative trends**: For example, when monitoring memory usage in computing an upward trend may be of interest as it may be indicative of a memory leak,
* **Changes in the dynamic range of values**: For example, when monitoring the exceptions thrown by a cloud service, any changes in the dynamic range of values could indicate instability in the health of the service, and
* **Spikes and Dips**: For example, when monitoring the number of login failures in a service or number of checkouts in an e-commerce site, spikes or dips could indicate abnormal behavior.

These machine learning detectors track such changes in values over time and report ongoing changes in their values as anomaly scores. They do not require adhoc threshold tuning and their scores can be used to control false positive rate. The anomaly detection API is useful in several scenarios like service monitoring by tracking KPIs over time, usage monitoring through metrics such as number of searches, numbers of clicks, performance monitoring through counters like memory, CPU, file reads, etc. over time.

The Anomaly Detection offering comes with useful tools to get you started.

* The [web application](http://anomalydetection-aml.azurewebsites.net/) helps you evaluate and visualize the results of anomaly detection APIs on your data.

## API Deployment
You can deploy the API to your Azure subscription from the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/MachineLearningAPI/Anomaly-Detection-2).  This will deploy two AzureML Web Services (and their related resources) to your Azure subscription - one for anomaly detection with seasonality detection, and one without seasonality detection.  Once the deployment has completed, you will be able to manage your APIs from the [AzureML web services](https://services.azureml.net/webservices/) page.  From this page, you will be able to find your endpoint locations, API keys, as well as sample code for calling the API.  More detailed instructions are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-manage-new-webservice).

## Scaling the API
By default, your deployment will have a free Dev/Test billing plan which includes 1,000 transactions/month and 2 compute hours/month.  You can upgrade to another plan as per your needs.  Details on the pricing of different plans are available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/machine-learning/) under "Production Web API pricing".

## Managing AML Plans 
You can manage your billing plan [here](https://services.azureml.net/plans/).  The plan name will be based on the resource group name you chose when deploying the API, plus a string that is unique to your subscription.  Instructions on how to upgrade your plan are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-manage-new-webservice) under the "Managing billing plans" section.

## API Definition
The web service provides a REST-based API over HTTPS that can be consumed in different ways including a web or mobile application, R, Python, Excel, etc.  You send your time series data to this service via a REST API call, and it runs a combination of the three anomaly types described above.

## Calling the API
In order to call the API, you will need to know the endpoint location and API key.  Both of these, along with sample code for calling the API, is available from the [AzureML web services](https://services.azureml.net/webservices/) page.  Navigate to the desired API, and then click the "Consume" tab to find them.  Note that you can call the API as a Swagger API (i.e. with the URL parameter `format=swagger`) or as a non-Swagger API (i.e. without the `format` URL parameter).  The sample code uses the Swagger format.  Below is an example request and response in non-Swagger format.  These examples are to the seasonality endpoint.  The non-seasonality endpoint is similar.

### Score API
The Score API is used for running anomaly detection on non-seasonal time series data. The API runs a number of anomaly detectors on the data and returns their anomaly scores. 
The figure below shows an example of anomalies that the Score API can detect. This time series has 2 distinct level changes, and 3 spikes. The red dots show the time at which the level change is detected, while the black dots show the detected spikes.
![Score API][1]

### Detectors
The anomaly detection API supports detectors in 3 broad categories. Details on specific input parameters and outputs for each detector can be found in the following table.

| Detector Category | Detector | Description | Input Parameters | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spike Detectors |TSpike Detector |Detect spikes and dips based on far the values are from first and third quartiles |*tspikedetector.sensitivity:* takes integer value in the range 1-10, default: 3; Higher values will catch more extreme values thus making it less sensitive |TSpike: binary values – ‘1’ if a spike/dip is detected, ‘0’ otherwise |
| Spike Detectors | ZSpike Detector |Detect spikes and dips based on how far the datapoints are from their mean |*zspikedetector.sensitivity:* take integer value in the range 1-10, default: 3; Higher values will catch more extreme values making it less sensitive |ZSpike: binary values – ‘1’ if a spike/dip is detected, ‘0’ otherwise | |
| Slow Trend Detector |Slow Trend Detector |Detect slow positive trend as per the set sensitivity |*trenddetector.sensitivity:* threshold on detector score (default: 3.25, 3.25 – 5 is a reasonable range to select this from; The higher the less sensitive) |TScore: floating number representing anomaly score on trend |
| Level Change Detectors | Bidirectional Level Change Detector |Detect both upward and downward level change as per the set sensitivity |*bileveldetector.sensitivity:* threshold on detector score (default: 3.25, 3.25 – 5 is a reasonable range to select this from; The higher the less sensitive) |RPScore: floating number representing anomaly score on upward and downward level change | |

### Parameters

### Output
The API runs all detectors on your time series data and returns anomaly scores and binary spike indicators for each point in time. The table below lists outputs from the API. 

| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time |Timestamps from raw data, or aggregated (and/or) imputed data if aggregation (and/or) missing data imputation is applied |
| Data |Values from raw data, or aggregated (and/or) imputed data if aggregation (and/or) missing data imputation is applied |

### ScoreWithSeasonality API
The ScoreWithSeasonality API is used for running anomaly detection on time series that have seasonal patterns. This API is useful to detect deviations in seasonal patterns.  
The following figure shows an example of anomalies detected in a seasonal time series. The time series has one spike (the 1st black dot), two dips (the 2nd black dot and one at the end), and one level change (red dot). Note that both the dip in the middle of the time series and the level change are only discernable after seasonal components are removed from the series.

The detectors in the seasonality endpoint are similar to the ones in the non-seasonality endpoint, but with slightly different parameter names.
